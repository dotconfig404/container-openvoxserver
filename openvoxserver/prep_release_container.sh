# Install gems into the system CRuby gem path. These back the tools that run
# under the distro Ruby inside the container: the `puppet`/`facter` CLIs (used
# by the entrypoint, e.g. `puppet config print`), the `puppetserver ca` CLI
# (its cli/apps/ca app runs under the distro Ruby via /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/ruby
# and needs openvoxserver-ca plus its hocon dependency), and the `r10k`
# convenience symlink created below. racc and syslog are stdlib gems dropped
# from default Ruby 3.4+, installed here for the distro Ruby. rugged is a native
# extension that cannot load on JRuby.
#
# NOTE: this path is NOT on puppetserver's JRuby gem-path. hiera-eyaml is needed
# only by the server JVM (for eyaml Hiera lookups), so it is installed solely
# into the JRuby gem-home further down, along with openvox. See #148.

# Install the gems the puppetserver JVM loads at runtime into the JRuby

# path (e.g. /var/lib/gems/3.x), which is NOT on puppetserver's JRuby gem-path,
# so any gem the server loads is invisible there. openvox provides puppet as a
# server library, and hiera-eyaml is required for eyaml-encrypted Hiera lookups
# during catalog compilation. The other gems above are CLI tools that run under
# the distro Ruby (not the JVM), so they are not needed here. See #148.

# Puppet 4 functions load via the Pops system loader, rooted at puppet's own lib
# rather than ruby-load-path. Since #141 gem-installs openvox instead of using
# the OS packages (whose openvoxdb-termini colocated everything in vendor_ruby),
# that root is the gem lib, so puppetdb_query would otherwise be unknown.
