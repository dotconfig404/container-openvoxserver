This project hosts the Containerfile and the required scripts to build a OpenVox Server container image.
See the [OpenVox Packages](https://github.com/orgs/OpenVoxProject/packages) for available versions.

You can run a copy of Puppet Server with the following Docker command:

```bash
podman run --name openvox --hostname openvox ghcr.io/openvoxproject/openvoxserver:8.13.0
```

Although it is not strictly necessary to name the container `openvox`, this is
useful when working with the other OpenVox images, as they will look for a server
on that hostname by default.

If you would like to start the OpenVox Server with your own Puppet code, you can
mount your own directory at `/etc/puppetlabs/code`:

```shell
podman run --name openvox --hostname openvox -v ./code:/etc/puppetlabs/code ghcr.io/openvoxproject/openvoxserver:8.13.0
```

For compose file see: [CRAFTY](https://github.com/voxpupuli/crafty/tree/main/openvox/oss)

## Informations

### End of Life for OpenVox Server 7

⚠️ On February 28, 2025, OpenVox/Puppet 7 entered its end-of-life phase.
Consequently, no new OpenVox Server 7 releases will be build.
Existing versions will be retained for continued access.

### Migration

Before updating to a newer version of your container, you should check the [migration document](MIGRATION.md)

## Note about environment caching

⚠️ The OpenVox Server has [the environment caching](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/server/admin-api/v1/environment-cache.html) enabled by default.
You should explicitly call the API endpoint to clear the cache when a new environment is deployed.
See the `curl` example below.

```bash
curl -i --cert $(puppet config print hostcert) \
--key $(puppet config print hostprivkey) \
--cacert $(puppet config print cacert) \
-X DELETE \
https://$(puppet config print server):8140/puppet-admin-api/v1/environment-cache?environment=production
```

Another option is to disable the environment caching by setting the `OPENVOXSERVER_ENVIRONMENT_TIMEOUT` environment variable to zero (`0`).

## Version schema

Images are published to `ghcr.io/openvoxproject/openvoxserver` and `docker.io/voxpupuli/openvoxserver`.
Ubuntu is the default image variant and therefore has no operating system suffix.
Alpine images use the `-alpine` suffix.

| Tag | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<openvox.version>-v<container.version>` | `8.13.0-v1.2.3` | Immutable Ubuntu container release |
| `<openvox.version>-v<container.version>-alpine` | `8.13.0-v1.2.3-alpine` | Immutable Alpine container release |
| `<openvox.version>` | `8.13.0` | Latest build for an OpenVox version, using Ubuntu |
| `<openvox.version>-alpine` | `8.13.0-alpine` | Latest Alpine build for an OpenVox version |
| `<openvox.major>` | `8` | Latest build for an OpenVox major version, using Ubuntu |
| `<openvox.major>-alpine` | `8-alpine` | Latest Alpine build for an OpenVox major version |
| `latest` | `latest` | Latest Ubuntu build from the `main` branch |
| `latest-alpine` | `latest-alpine` | Latest Alpine build from the `main` branch |

Builds from the `main` branch are additionally tagged as
`<openvox.version>-main` and `<openvox.version>-main-alpine`.

Example using an immutable container release:

```shell
podman run --name openvox --hostname openvox -v ./code:/etc/puppetlabs/code/ ghcr.io/openvoxproject/openvoxserver:8.13.0-v1.2.3
```

The OpenVox version describes the server version contained in the image.
The container version follows semantic versioning and describes changes to the container image independently of the OpenVox version.

## Initialization Scripts

If you would like to do additional initialization, add a directory called `/container-custom-entrypoint.d/` and fill it with `.sh` scripts.

You can also create sub-directories in `/container-custom-entrypoint.d/` for scripts that have to run at different stages.

- `/container-custom-entrypoint.d/pre-default/` - scripts that run before the default entrypoints scripts.
- `/container-custom-entrypoint.d/` - scripts that run after the default entrypoint scripts, but before the openvoxserver service is started.
- `/container-custom-entrypoint.d/post-startup/` - scripts that run after the openvoxserver service is started.
- `/container-custom-entrypoint.d/sigterm-handler/` - scripts that run when the container receives a SIGTERM signal.
- `/container-custom-entrypoint.d/post-execution/` - scripts that run after the openvoxserver service has stopped.

## Persistence

If you plan to use the in-server CA, restarting the container can cause the server's keys and certificates to change, causing agents and the server to stop trusting each other.
To prevent this, you can persist the default cadir, `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca`.
For example:

```shell
podman run -v $PWD/ca-ssl:/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca ghcr.io/openvoxproject/openvoxserver:8.13.0
```

or in compose:

```yaml
services:
  puppet:
    image: ghcr.io/openvoxproject/openvoxserver:8.13.0
    # ...
    volumes:
      - ./ca-ssl:/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca
```

### Permissions

#### Rootless Podman

When using rootless Podman, the OpenVox Server process runs directly as the non-root `puppet` user (UID 64604) with the root group (GID 0).
This can lead to permission issues with bind mount volumes, which you may want to use for the OpenVox SSL and CA directories. For example:

```shell
-v ./openvoxserver-ssl:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl
-v ./openvoxserver-ca:/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca
```

By default the container will attempt to correct permissions. For a large number of files it may spend a long time at "Adjusting mounted CA directory ownership". This is normal.
If this still runs into permissions issues please check selinux and related security layers. You can relabel the host directory using the `:Z` flag:

```shell
-v ./openvoxserver-ca:/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca:Z
```

Please be careful not to mount any vital system directories when using this flag.

If you're starting from scratch we instead recommend using a named volume. For example, note that the left value is not a path:

```shell
-v puppet_ca:/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca
```

Permissions are managed for you, and from there the volume can be migrated using `podman volume export` and `podman volume import` commands.

#### Docker

Docker always runs rootfull, and does not need permissions adjustments.

## How to deploy OpenVox/Puppet code

### ✅ Preferred way to deploy your code

We recommend to use the [r10k](https://github.com/voxpupuli/container-r10k) container and use a shared volume to deploy your code to the OpenVox Server.

Example usage: <https://github.com/voxpupuli/crafty/blob/main/openvox/r10k/README.md>

The r10k container can be scheduled to run at regular intervals to keep your OpenVox Server up to date with the latest code changes.
Or you use the [r10k-webhook](https://github.com/voxpupuli/container-r10k-webhook) container to trigger a deployment when a new commit is pushed to your repository.

### 🔥 Not recommended way, but often used, pattern from the non-container world

At the moment the container has r10k installed.
You can use it to deploy your code from within the container.

🚧 ___Please be informed that this might change, and we’re considering removing the r10k installation from the container in the future.___

Create a `r10k.yaml` file with the following content and mount it to the container at `/etc/puppetlabs/r10k/r10k.yaml`:

```yaml
---
pool_size: 8
deploy:
  generate_types: true
  exclude_spec: true
  incremental: true
  purge_levels: [ 'deployment', 'environment', 'puppetfile' ]
cachedir: "/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/r10k"
sources:
  puppet:
    basedir: "/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments"
    remote: https://github.com/voxpupuli/controlrepo.git
```

Run the main container with the following command, which mounts the `r10k.yaml` file to the container:

```shell
podman run -it --rm --name openvox -v ./r10k:/etc/puppetlabs/r10k:ro ghcr.io/openvoxproject/openvoxserver:latest
````

Then you can run the following command to deploy your code.

```shell
podman exec openvox r10k deploy environment -mv
```

## Differences between the Ubuntu and Alpine containers

| Topic | Ubuntu variant | Alpine variant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base | Ubuntu 26.04 | Alpine Linux 3.24 |
| C library | glibc | musl, with `gcompat` installed for limited glibc compatibility |
| `rugged` | Uses Ubuntu's `ruby-rugged` package because the rubygems version needs a newer `libgit2` | Builds the configured `rugged` gem during the image build with SSH support |
